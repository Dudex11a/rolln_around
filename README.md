This is a simple ball game made by me (Dudex11a).
Roll'n Around was last built with Godot 4.4.beta3

Roll'n Around is a basic "get ball to goal" game.

My incentives for this project are: 
- To finish a small project so I fully understand what goes into a project like this, from start to finish, so I feel more confident to be able to work on larger projects.
- To finish a small project to help bolster a public portfolio online of my programming experience.
- It's fun making games!

The Godot project is located in the "project" directory.
I keep my own notes on the project in the "notes" directory. I mainly use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage the notes.

Before making this repo public I reset the git repo because there was my own PIA within the repo and I didn't want to go through the process of clearing and confirming that each instance of PIA is removed after removing it.
