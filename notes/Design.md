# TODO
- First levels detail the levels that explain the mechanics of the game.
	- 1
		- [x] Moving
		- [x] Goal
		- [x] Jumping
		- [x] Sliding down slopes
	- 2
		- [x] Area Transition
		- [x] Spoon
			- I don't think I need to explain Spoons. Just the way their currently presented I think it can be inferred that when you collect them, you have them. I think that's all I need. I'd rather not explain something if I don't have to or I can explain it through mechanics.
		- [x] Slopes that are too steep to ascend
		- [x] Needing speed to make it up certain slopes
	- 3
		- [ ] Spring
		- [ ] Bumper
		- [ ] Boost Panel
	- 4
		- [ ] Fall -> Jumping
		- [ ] Wall Jumping
- I CAN MAKE THE FIRST LEVEL'S SPOONS HARD. I think it'll make them more interesting instead of "baby level".
# Whole level ideas
***
## Group 1
***
## The Basics
### This level covers concepts
- Moving
- Goal
![[the_basics.excalidraw]]
***
## Up the steps
### This level covers concepts
- Jumping
![[up_the_steps.excalidraw]]
***
## Double Doughnut
Currently I changed this idea to "a_couple_rings". The idea is similar.
### This level covers concepts
- Sliding down slopes
![[double_doughnut.excalidraw]]
***
## Three perspectives
### This level covers concepts
- Area Transition
![[a_change_in_perspective.excalidraw]]
***
## Group 2

***
## Many Spoons

### This level covers concepts
- Spoons
### Thoughts
- Put Spoon in a place where it's just about impossible to complete the level without collecting at least one Spoon. Probably in a doorway or gate of some kind.

***
## Half-pipe ???
### This level covers concepts
- Slopes that are too steep to ascend
- Needing speed to make it up certain slopes
![[half-pipe.excalidraw]]
***
## Well timed jumps
- A bunch of floating platforms with the goal at the end.

# Thoughts
## Foreshadowing in early levels of mechanics or concepts that are explained later.
## What do I like about the game as it is?
- Not much really
## What do I not like?
- Feels like it lacks intrigue in the mechanics (on my part).
## Should I remove jump?
- I don't think so, I've already done so much for it and it makes the game more unique. I might want to make it shorter so there isn't as much aerial confusion with 3d depth going on
## What are ideas I want to and can reasonably express through levels / gameplay?
### Potential Ideas
- Improving over time
- To bring to completion
- Comfort?

- Main: To bring to completion
- Side: Feeling smart
	- Solving a secret puzzle throughout the levels
## What WEIRD SHIT can I do?
- Getting progressively more aesthetically different
	- Getting more {THING} over the levels
		- Realistic
		- Spooky
- Visual storytelling through the levels
	- What story would I want to tell though?
