Real quick, how do I want the sounds to sound? I kind of want to make them in some sort of style? I could try to make them more musically? Restrict myself to certain instruments for different groups of actions? I don't think I'm going to let myself think of this much, I think I'm just going to go with that idea because it sounds solid enough.

Do I make my own instruments, my own soundfont?
I do know how to do that and I do think that'd be cool. I'll try to make the soundfont fairly simple so I don't over scope.
